<h2>GI Allotment Club</h2>

<p>Date: <strong>3rd Sunday of the Month</strong></p>

<p><strong>Upcoming Dates</strong></p>

<p>Sunday 20th September 2015</p>

<p>Time: <strong>1pm - 4pm</strong></p>

<p>Meeting point: <strong>East Finchley tube station</strong></p>

<p>In January, GI launched its first 'Allotment Club'. We want to give young trans people the opportunity to enjoy being outside, learn how to grow vegetables and to get as muddy as they like. We do quite a lot of chatting at Gendered Intelligence, but this isn't for everyone. This is an opportunity to make friends and to hang out without the need to feel that you have to talk.</p>

<p>Young people can learn about what plants needs to grow and how to manage an allotment space. There will also be hot chocolate to drink.</p>
