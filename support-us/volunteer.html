<p>Do you want to volunteer for Gendered Intelligence? <br><br></p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence exists to increase understandings of gender diversity and to improve the quality of life of trans people, and young trans people in particular. <br><br></p>

<p>In line with this mission Gendered Intelligence seeks to involve volunteers to: <br><br></p>

<ul>
<li><p>add value to our projects and ensure they meet the needs of our service users by supporting our staff in carrying out their work.</p></li>
<li><p>increase our contact with the community we serve by efficiently managing our volunteer pool to expand relevant services.</p></li>
<li><p>provide new skills and perspectives by endeavouring to recruit a diverse cohort of volunteers representative of the many different lived experiences of trans people and the allies of our community.</p></li>
<li><p>combat the lower rates of employment in the trans community by up-skilling our volunteers through our available programs as relevant to their interests and additional training as applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>build a greater and more inclusive sense of community for volunteers and service users by encouraging applications from isolated trans people from marginalised backgrounds and creating a team of trans people and our cis allies committed to a shared goal of greater trans inclusion. <br><br></p></li>
</ul>

<p>We induct successful volunteer applicants on a regular basis. <br><br></p>

<h2>Office Admin</h2>

<p><br></p>

<strong><a href="/static/images/2018/03/27/13-44-30-Office Admin Program.pdf">Office Admin</strong></a>: Taking part in the Office Admin program will involve volunteering at the
Gendered Intelligence Office by assisting with general clerical duties,
organising the office and assisting with other day-to-day tasks. Office
Admin volunteers can develop to focus on supporting the area of work
theyâ€™re most passionate about.

<h2>Ambassadors' Network</h2> 

<p><br></p>

<p>Joining the Ambassadors' Network will involve volunteering at internal events by representing Gendered Intelligence to the public at stalls booked at external events and internal events such as our annual conference.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Youth Group Support</h2> 

<p><br></p>

<p>Taking part in the Youth Group Support program will involve volunteering at the
Gendered Intelligence youth groups by supporting our Youth Group
Leaders and creating a safe and supportive space for our young people.
We run youth groups for a wide range of ages from our Under 12s group,
our 16-20 group, and our under 21s groups. We run youth groups in London, Leeds, and online. To volunteer, you should live in one of these cities or in short travelling distance to one of them.</p>

<p>In London, we run three groups: <a href="../trans-youth/11-15.html">Under 16</a>, <a href="http://genderedintelligence.co.uk/support-us/trans-youth/16-20">16-25</a> and <a href="../trans-youth/BAME.html">BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic)</a>.</p>

  
<p>There are
also opportunities to help out at our events for young people like camps. <em><strong>Volunteers must identify as trans and/or non-binary as our youth groups are trans only spaces. To volunteer for the TPOC youth group, you should identify as a person of colour. Applicants must undergo an Enhanced DBS with Children's Barred List check.</strong></em>  <br><br></p>

<p>We welcome all people, including those who are wishing to volunteer as part of their studies, cis allies such as friends and family of trans people and members of the trans community who are looking to enhance their CV or employment credentials. <br><br></p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence also welcomes volunteers' suggestion and development of new ideas and projects. <br><br></p>
