<h2>Could you help out at a GI youth group?</h2>

<p>At Gendered Intelligence, our youth groups are growing every month. Weâ€™re looking for enthusiastic <strong>trans-identified</strong> volunteers to work alongside our youth group leaders to help facilitate and shape our groups.<br></p>

<p>If you are aged <strong>18 or over</strong> and would like to work with a range of young trans people aged 10 - 25 in cities across England, read on to find out how to apply to become a Gendered Intelligence youth group volunteer.
Where could you volunteer?</p>

<p>We run youth groups in London, Leeds, and online.
</ul>

<p>To volunteer, you should live in one of these cities or in short travelling distance to one of them.</p>

<p>We need volunteers for our Leeds group and TPoC group in London.</p>

<p>In London, we run three groups: <a href="../trans-youth/11-15.html">Under 16</a>, <a href="http://genderedintelligence.co.uk/support-us/trans-youth/16-25">16-25</a> and <a href="../trans-youth/BAME.html">BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic)</a>.</p>

<h2>What are we looking for in a volunteer?</h2>

<p>Working with a large group of young trans people can be inspiring, but you will need to be committed to build up a good relationship with the group.  We would like to hear from people who are:</p>

<ul>
<li>reliable</li>
<li>open to reflect on their attitudes and behaviour</li>
<li>able to work with other people in a group setting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What will you gain from being a youth group volunteer?</h2>

<p>Being a youth group volunteer gives you the opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
<li>build confidence in meeting new people and speaking to groups</li>
<li>experience planning and facilitating workshops and other sessions</li>
<li>contribute to the lives of young trans people.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also have the chance to volunteer at GI events and on our <a href="../trans-youth/camping.html">annual camping trip</a>.</p>

<h2>How can I apply? <br></h2>

<p>It's OK if you do not have experience of working with young people.</p>

<p>The young people we work with demonstrate that being trans never means just one thing. We want to support all sorts of difference.

We do our best to reduce the barriers to volunteering with GI.</p>
