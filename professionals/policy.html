<h2>Professional Consultancy - Trans Inclusion and Equality</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence offers professional consultancy support to help with specific needs. All our consultancy can be offered via remote channels.  Once restrictions surrounding Coronavirus are lifted, we will also be able to visit in person as outlined below. <br><br>
<strong>Our consultancy service can:</strong><br><br>
- Create, co-produce or review written materials, such as policy, guidance, communications, FAQs, scripts and more<br><br>
- Carry out information gathering via surveys, focus groups and/or desktop review<br><br>
- Improve monitoring and reporting through development of forms and other practical processes<br><br>
- Address particular questions or concerns; help develop a deeper understanding of trans issues<br><br>
- Find positive ways forward in individual or challenging circumstances<br><br>
- Develop in-house training content for internal cascade<br><br>
- Assist with any other trans-related queries<br><br></p>

<p><strong>How we work</strong>: We are open to working together with organisations on any aspect of trans-inclusion and welcome opportunities to collaborate on responses to new or developing requirements. We aim to be client-centred in our approach and to consult in whatever way, or combination of ways, works best for you, we are happy to work via face to face meetings, phone, email or any other means.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong>: Our consultancy rate is £90-£160 per hour (plus travel expenses for any face-to-face meetings).<br>
When we work remotely, e.g. by phone/email, our minimum charge is 30 mins and then pro rata.<br>
When we work face to face, we have a sliding scale of minimum charges according to travel time.<br></p>

<p>If you would like a one hour initial scoping meeting for some initial expert advice and a discussion of how Gendered Intelligence can assist you with your trans inclusion work going forward, we can offer this from £90 for non-profit organisations and £120-160 for a commercial organisation (dependent on size).</p>

<p>We can arrange a 15 minute exploratory phone call free of charge.</p>

The suggestions of how to then frame these concepts to our audience is also so welcome!"</i> <strong>Rachel Ashcroft, Senior Development Manager, Mencap, 2020</strong></p>

<p><i>"I literally cannot thank you enough for your help on this. Your email was just fantastic and I found it helpful beyond words. It would have taken me about 6 months to come up with that wording, and I still wouldn’t have come up with it all / got it right!  And I thought the blog link was absolutely fantastic too! - so pertinent to the issue! ... Thank you so sincerely for all your help."</i>  <strong>Student Support &amp; Wellbeing, Russell Group University, 2019</strong></center></p>
