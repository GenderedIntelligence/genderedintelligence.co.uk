<h2>Working Alongside Trans, Gender Diverse and Questioning People</h2>

<p><b>A two-day training course for therapists and counsellors</b></p>

<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>This two-day course has been created in response to demand for more in-depth and specialist learning from therapists and counsellors themselves, and to the need of the wider trans community for a pool of trans-knowledgeable therapists and counsellors to draw on.</p>

<p>The training is a mix of formal presentations, interactive exercises and reflective discussions delivered in a small group learning environment by two professional trainers who combine extensive therapeutic and trans-specific knowledge and practice.<br><br></p>

<p><b>Upcoming dates</b><br>
To be confirmed</p>

<p><strong>Times:</strong></p>

<p>All courses 9:00 arrival for a prompt 9:30 start, close at 4:30</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><b>Cost: </b></p>

<ul><li>¬£355¬†(incl. Network membership)</li>
<li>¬£275¬†(excl. Network membership)</li></ul>

<p><b>The course fee includes:</b></p>

<ul><li>A course booklet, handouts, extensive list of links and online resources</li>
<li>Your first year‚Äôs membership of the GI Network for Therapists and Counsellors (¬£355 fee band only)</li>
<li>Listing in the Gendered Intelligence Therapists and Counsellors Directory (subject to criteria ‚Äì see Directory information below) (¬£355 fee band only)</li>
<li>An attendance certificate</li>
<li>Lunch and refreshments on both days</li></ul>

<p><br></p>

<p>We strongly recommend joining the network - it provides access to ongoing learning and support and also enables listing in the Directory which is already bringing new clients to the therapists listed.  However, if you would prefer not to join, or to join later, our fee band of <strong>¬£275</strong> is the fee for the training course alone.</p>

<p>(Bursaries are available - see 'Requesting a Place' below)</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>For:</strong></p>

<p>This course is for practising psychotherapists, therapists and counsellors, working in the fields of talking therapies (as opposed to physical therapies).</p>

<p>You may already be working alongside people who might be described as gender variant, gender non-conforming or gender dysphoric in clinical settings, but who might describe themselves with a very wide variety of different terms including trans, transgender, a person with a trans history, non-binary, gender questioning, gender expansive, genderqueer, gender fluid or agender, or who otherwise have an experience of gender that doesn‚Äôt align with society‚Äôs expectations in some way.</p>

<p>The course is also for those interested in beginning work alongside gender diverse people.</p>

<p>We particularly welcome bookings from QTIPOC / trans therapists and counsellors.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Numbers:</strong> Maximum of 12 participants to ensure individual learning needs are met, and to allow for social distancing within the venue.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>This session is also available as an in-house course.</strong> <u><a href="mailto:training@genderedintelligence.co.uk">Contact us</a></u> for details<br></p>

<h2>Course Outline</h2>

<p>This two-day course will cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gender diversity in the current social context</li>
<li>A basic introduction to relevant legislation, including The Equality Act 2010, and how it might relate to service provision</li>
<li>The WPATH (The world Professional Association for Transgender Health) Standards of care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People and how they inform good practice</li>
<li>The treatment pathways and medical contexts relevant to transgender people and their families</li>
<li>Specific terminology, skills and knowledge relating to the use of language when working alongside trans and gender variant people</li>
<li>Gender Theory and how it can inform good practice in therapeutic work with trans people and their families</li>
<li>Theoretical models and psychotherapy practices that support work with trans and gender diverse people</li>
<li>Current dilemmas in practice with transgender and gender diverse people</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
The course takes a generic / integrative approach, providing useful tools to take back into your way of working.</p>

<p>Some elements are drawn from Gendered Intelligence's core half-day general course "Introduction to Trans Awareness".  If you have previously attended that course, you'll find a few of the exercises on the first day familiar.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>At the end of the course, participants will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Appreciate how sex, gender and sexual orientation interact</li>
<li>Feel more confident in understanding how gender is constructed and the impact this has on identity, relationships and therapy</li>
<li>Understand key terms and language, and have strategies to approach their continuing evolution</li>
<li>Understand the legal and medical contexts for working with trans clients</li>
<li>Know a range of ideas, tools and theoretical underpinnings to enable better conversations about gender and gender diversity in therapeutic practice</li>
<li>Be able to identify good practice in relation to working alongside and supporting transgender and gender variant clients</li>
<li>Feel more confident to engage in conversations about gender and gender diversity</li>
<li>Have additional learning resources and know where to find further helpful materials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quotes from Previous Participants</h2>

<p>Here are just a few comments from previous delegates:</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you so much for an amazing two days. I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience - not just at a learning level, but also the wonderful energies you've brought with you.  This is an area I want to specialise in and I feel much more confident now.  I loved the level of interaction and the pace and the fact there was time for reflection between exercises.  Amanda and Lee, you co-work with total fluidity - you're brilliant.  All done in such a gentle yet informative way.‚Äù Marilyn Carre, session participant, Jersey course</p>

<p>‚ÄúOne of the best short courses I have done in a long time.  Structure very well organised, thoughtful and good mix of presentations / discussion / trans experience / reflection / info etc.  Non judgmental, but effective challenging.   Excellent delivery of programme.  Good co-ordination between presenters.  Rich material.  Excellent booklet with info and exercises.  Well designed.‚Äù Gail Simon, Counselling Supervisor, Manchester course</p>

<p>‚ÄúVery open, interesting, informative discussions with widely diverse group of therapists and backgrounds.  Lived experience was invaluable.‚Äù Annabelle Morrison, Clinical Psychologist, CAMHS</p>

<p>‚ÄúI loved all of it, especially the variety of activities.  It was great!  Great pace, space to debrief and lots of individual activities to help process and reflect.  [The second day] was so hands on and useful, especially the role play and explaining theories of gender.  This was such a strong course with fabulous trainers.  I feel so much more prepared to have conversations with colleagues/friends around gender identity and how to work with gender variant people.  Wish it was 3 days! :-)‚Äù Shannon Leoni, High School Social and Emotional Counselor (Belgium)</p>
