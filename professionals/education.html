<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>In light of the Coronavirus situation, we have adapted all our services for remote delivery.<br><br></p>

<h2>Services in Education</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence offers a number of different trans training packages for staff in schools, colleges, universities and youth services. We also provide consultancy for educational institutions. We deliver one-to-one mentoring for young trans, non-binary and gender questioning young people. We offer educational workshops, lectures and assemblies for students to learn about gender diversity. You'll find a brief summary of all services on this page - click the links for full details.</p>

<h2>Staff Trans Awareness Training</h2>

<p>We are well-versed in training educational professionals. Around 40% of our training takes place in educational settings.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../education/training.html"><strong>In-House Training For Staff</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>We can provide one or more sessions specifically for your school at a date and time convenient to you.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="cpd.html"><strong>CPD Sessions</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>We also run regular general CPD sessions that anyone wishing to be inclusive of trans people in their working life can attend to learn more about trans issues, and what trans inclusion typically involves.  This is often suitable if you are a sole trader or a very small organisation; or if you wish to try us out before bringing us in house.</p>

<h2>Consultancy and Other Support</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="policy.html"><strong>Addressing Queries and Challenges, Policy and Guidance Development</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>We can bring our non-judgmental approach to support you to work through queries and challenges you may encounter. 
 We also have experience and expertise in developing text and documentation, such as equality and inclusion policies and guidance, communications pieces, web content and similar.</p>

<h2>One-to-One Mentoring for Students</h2>

<p>We provide one-to-one mentoring to trans, non-binary and gender questioning people in educational settings. Currently, we are delivering this remotely due to COVID.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="mentoring.html"><strong>One-to-one Mentoring</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Workshops, Lectures and Assemblies for Students</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="schools-and-youth-services/creative-workshops.html"><strong>Workshops, Assemblies and Lectures</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>We can provide workshops themed around gender / LGBTQI identities to help pupils of all ages understand diversity. These may be especially beneficial to encourage understanding amongst the peers of trans students in your school or youth service.</p>
