<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>In light of the Coronavirus situation, we have adapted our face to face speaking offer for remote delivery.<br>
Gendered Intelligence speakers can now be booked for e-conferences.<br><br>
Provision of information stalls and mailouts of event packs have been suspended for the time being.<br></p>

<h2>Gendered Intelligence Speakers</h2>

<p><strong>Why not book a Gendered Intelligence speaker for your next diversity event?</strong></p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence can provide amazing speakers, who draw on their passion for a more inclusive world to deliver key note speeches and to take part in panel discussions, Q&amp;As and other similar activities. These can be for conferences, equality and diversity events, social networks and other activities. <br></p>

<p>To book a GI speaker or make an enquiry about costs, email <a href="mailto:events@genderedintelligence.co.uk">events@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a>. <br><br></p>

<p>If you are looking for more formal presentations or facilitated workshops that deliver specific learning outcomes, please visit our <a href="training.html">training page</a>.</p>

<h2>Attending with a Stall</h2>

<p><strong>[TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED OWING TO CORONAVIRUS]</strong><br><br>
If you are running a fair for young people with information stalls, we provide a volunteer to be on a stall as a first point of contact.</p>

<p>They can talk to people about the latest projects Gendered Intelligence is running, help them to select the best resources from the free pack provided, show them round our website and other media, sign them up to our relevant e-mail lists and generally provide personal face-to-face contact.</p>

<p>If we donâ€™t have a volunteer available, (or in addition to our volunteer) we can provide a short rolling presentation that can be set up on a laptop for people to watch, or included in any presentational reel you are showing at the event. In addition, we can provide our Gendered Intelligence film (2014).</p>
