<h2>Quality of Life Survey</h2>

<p><strong>How good is quality of life for trans &amp; gender nonconforming adults in England?</strong></p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence and the <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/institute-management-studies/">Institute of Management Studies</a> at Goldsmiths University of London have run an online survey since 2016 on the quality of life of trans and gender nonconforming adults in England.</p>

<p>The first survey ran from August - October 2016. Over 900 people took the survey. The second ran from August -October 2017.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/institute-management-studies/staff/lloyd/"><strong>Dr Jo Lloyd</strong></a> from the Institute of Management Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London is leading the study.</p>

<h2>Brief Report of Initial Findings</h2>

<p>What stressors particularly affect the quality of life of trans and gender non-conforming adults in England?</p>

<p>In May 2018, we produced brief report of our findings from our initial survey in 2016.</p>

<p>The report looks at what impacts a range of quality of life indicators - including life satisfaction, mental health, self-esteem, social inclusion and cultural participation.</p>

<p>We will be sharing further findings from 2016 and 2017 surveys at the Gendered Intelligence conference in November 2018.</p>
