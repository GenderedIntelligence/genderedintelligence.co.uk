<h2>Gender expression</h2>

<p>We live in a world that likes to separate out the boys from the girls, the men from the women and this can certainly be located in our clothes retailing industry. We would not want to put any one reading this in a box or be telling people what to wear regardless of your self-identified gender. i.e. if you identify as a girl and wear bovver boots or a guy who likes to paint his nails or a mash up of all gender expressions and styles then we salute you!</p>

<p>Being trans and navigating this world can sometimes be tricky. So we have gathered some shared thoughts that hopefully will be useful for you. Keep us posted. We can add your suggestions here too.</p>
