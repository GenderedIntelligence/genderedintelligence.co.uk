<h2>Mental Health and Trans People</h2>

<p>Identifying as trans, non-binary or questioning your gender can be very affirming, but it can also mean a lot of worry and this can affect your mental health. It can also feel stressful to think about how our friends and family are going to respond. Not conforming to social expectations of gender – how girls and boys are supposed to behave, present themselves and see themselves – can also be difficult.</p>

<p>Trans people are more likely to be affected by mental health problems. Many trans people have poor mental health or experience mental distress and can find it more difficult to ask for or access the help that they need. This is in part due to societal pressures, worries about acceptance among family and friends and fitting in.</p>

<p>Daily life and transition can be difficult for trans people. However, transitioning is almost always a liberating process and coming out as trans can lead to finding new friends and new support networks. Talking about mental health, finding ways of self-care, and having the courage to ask for help can all be life-saving for trans people.</p>
