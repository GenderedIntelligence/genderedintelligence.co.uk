					<h2>Changing your Department of Work and Pensions Details</h2>

<p>The Department of Work and Pensions deals with:</p>

<p>•   Your National Insurance contributions (taken out of your wages when you're working)</p>

<p>•   Jobseekers allowance and benefits</p>

<p>•   Pensions</p>

<p>It's important to change your name with them to ensure everything is correct with regards to your payslips when you're working, and when dealing with the Job Centre for any benefit-related enquiries.</p>

<h2>Documents required:</h2>

<p>•   Original copy of your statutory declaration or deed poll.</p>

<p>•   Doctor's letter stating change of gender. (Note: the DWP will not change your gender on the system until you have a Gender Recognition certificate, but they will change your name and title).</p>

<p>•   Covering letter</p>

<p>There are no costs to changing your name and gender markers with the DWP.</p>

<h2>Where to send it</h2>

<p>Send a certified copy of your name change deed or statutory declaration with your doctor’s letter, together with a letter from yourself quoting your National Insurance (NI) number to the <strong>central office of the Department for Work and Pensions</strong> (DWP) as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Department of Social Security <br>
Special Section D, Room 105H <br>
Contributions Agency Central Operations <br>
Newcastle Upon Tyne <br>
NE98 1YX.</strong></p>

<p>The DWP will acknowledge your change of name and title and reply in a standard letter stating that the change will have no effect to any legal entitlement to state benefits, especially the state pension.</p>

<p>You may also receive a new plastic NI number card which will show the new title and name but there will be nothing on the card to indicate a previous name.</p>

<p>When you change your name with the DWP as a trans person, they will put a special restriction on your account which means only authorised members of staff can access your information.</p>

<p>This often stops some employees, such as staff at Job Centres, to be able to access your records. This protects your confidentiality but <strong>can cause delays</strong> when trying to sort out some issues. You may need to allow extra time to sort out any issues as a result.</p>

<p>Each individual is only allowed to ever receive one replacement National Insurance card in their lifetime. Trans people who change their names therefore are not entitled to a new card if it is lost, so look after it.</p>
