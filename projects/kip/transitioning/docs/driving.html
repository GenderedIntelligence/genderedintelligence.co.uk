					<h2>Changing your driving licence</h2>

<p>If you've never had a driving licence before, look at the gov.uk website for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/id-for-driving-licence">list of documents</a> that are accepted in your application.</p>

<p>The best way to get one in your new name / gender is to change your passport first and then apply for one online using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence">Government Gateway</a>.</p>

<p>To change your existing driving licence, you need to get a form from your post office to apply for a driving license.</p>

<p>Documents required are:</p>

<p>•   Driving licence form</p>

<p>•   Your name change document (statutory declaration or deed poll)</p>

<p>•   Passport sized photograph</p>

<p>•   Covering letter requesting change or name and gender code.</p>

<p>You will be asked for a photograph which will be included on your new licence. Try to get a photo which you will be happy with for some time and make sure that it complies with the DVLA's criteria.</p>

<p>Send the form, along with a covering letter, to the DVLA, together with a copy of your letter from your health professional and a copy of your deed poll or statutory declaration, and your old driving licence.</p>

<p>If you change your name and hold a current driving licence you must inform the DVLA without delay. Failure to do so is an offence under section 99 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</p>

<p>The covering letter should state that:</p>

<p>•   you wish your legal name on the licence changes to the of your new legal name, and</p>

<p>•   that the gender code be altered to that of your self-identified gender.</p>
