<h2>Getting support</h2>

<p>There are two ways of getting support with your mental distress.</p>

<p>•   Support from those in your personal life. These include family members (close or extended), friends (on and off line), allies and peers.</p>

<p>•   <a href="services.html">Support from professionals</a>.</p>

<p>Professionals include social care services - key workers such as a social worker or a youth worker; the pastoral staff in educational settings are also responsible for supporting you; as well as mental health teams, councillors, therapists and others working with psychological services.</p>

<p>Other professional services include Citizens Advice Bureau, the Police (LGBT Officers), hospital staff as well as charity sector workers.</p>

<p>If you feel like you are suffering alone, remember that there is support available from professionals to help you with your anxieties, depression and other mental distress. These professionals can be arranged through appointments and referrals.</p>

<p>There are also a range of external support organisations and helplines which you can contact whenever you feel the need to. We would also encourage you to seek advice from your GP. They can advise you about appropriate treatment and advise on your condition.</p>

<p>You may find it useful to seek further advice from the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/low-mood-and-depression.aspx">NHS website</a>, there is an abundance of information here on issues relating to low mood, stress and anxiety, including tips for coping with depression.</p>
