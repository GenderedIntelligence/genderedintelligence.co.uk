					<h2>Gender Identity Clinics</h2>

<p>Gender identity clinics (GICs) are special clinics responsible for trans-related healthcare. This includes diagnosis with ‘gender dysphoria’, hormone prescriptions, and surgery referrals. These are usually a team of psychiatrists and psychologists. Some teams have endocrinologists and voice therapists too. Below is a list of GICs in the UK. GICs require a referral from a GP and sometimes from a local CMHT.</p>

<h2>Private practitioners for gender care.</h2>

<p>There are private practitioners that offer psychological services to trans people or people who are questioning their gender identity. You may wish to pursue private counselling and/ or psychotherapy to support you with your thinking about your gender identity. There are also a number of different private gender specialists who can diagnose gender dysphoria, prescribe hormone therapy and refer people for surgery. In most cases, you do not require a GP or psychiatrist referral - it's a case of phoning and making the appointment yourself. Individual practitioners will have different requirements for different types of treatment, so it's worth finding out more about the practice.</p>
