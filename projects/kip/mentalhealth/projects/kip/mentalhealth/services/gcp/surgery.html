					<h2>Surgery</h2>

<p>Some trans people choose to have surgery to make them feel more comfortable with their body. There are a number of surgical options available to trans people on the NHS as well as privately. It’s important to do plenty of research around the surgeons that carry out this treatment as well as the various methods or types of surgery that you will end up opting for. In addition talk to other trans people who have had the surgery that you are considering. There are plenty of ways to do this – visit a support group, join a facebook group or on line forum and watch youtube.</p>

<p>Images of surgery results are available on websites of surgeons, as well as websites like <a href="http://www.transbucket.com/">Transbucket</a> which have a variety of surgery results on trans men and women.</p>

<p>To have surgery on the NHS, you will be required to have met a criteria which will be outlined by your gender identity clinic. Usually, you must have been on hormones for a certain amount of time before surgery referrals will be made, but this varies from clinic to clinic.</p>

<p>You can also opt to have surgery abroad</p>
