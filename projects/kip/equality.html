<h2>Equality and Diversity</h2>

<p>Gendered Intelligence run <a href="../../professionals/training.html">equality and diversity training</a> that considers the protected characteristic 'gender reassignment'.</p>

<h2>Laws and Legislation</h2>

<p>You can read more about the protection <a href="equality/laws.html">trans people have under the Equality Act 2010</a>.</p>

<h2>Research and Studies</h2>

<p>There is a range of reports available online that consider the lived experiences of trans people. However, we think that more research and knowledge needs to be carried out to provide more up to date and accurate data that considers the everyday lives of trans individuals. It is noteable that more studies have been carried out in Scotland than in England, but in the absence of other data, it would be a reasonable starting point to assume that the experience south of the border is similar.</p>
