					<h2>Prejudicial Bullying</h2>

<p>Prejudicial bullying and discriminatory bullying is based on prejudice towards people because of a particular aspect of their identity – for example their sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, race and religion or belief. This type of bullying encompasses all the other types of bullying listed above, only for different reasons. This type of bullying can result in hate crimes.</p>

<p>When it comes to working or being educated, every person should have the right to feel safe. In law, trans people are protected from harassment and from being in a hostile environment.</p>

<h2>Gender related and transphobic bullying</h2>

<p>“Gendered harassment is any unwanted behaviour that enforces traditional, heterosexual gender norms. It is related to, and can overlap with, bullying. Forms of gendered harassment include sexual harassment; homophobic, bi-phobic, or transphobic harassment; and harassment for gender-nonconformity (Meyer, 2008, 2009).” (Sanders: 2013)</p>

<p>Gender related and transphobic bullying is the type of bullying that is important to us at Gendered Intelligence. There are increasing numbers of people who are expressing gender variance or sharing their trans status in schools and in everyday life. Despite legislation that works to protect trans people, transgender people are continuing to experience widespread discrimination.</p>

<p>If transphobic bullying is not addressed appropriately, it reinforces to everyone that it's okay to discriminate. These behaviours and words can have devastating results for everyone involved.</p>

<p>Examples of transphobic and gender related bullying consist of mean-spirited name-calling about a person's actual or perceived gender identity or gender expression, obscene and/or sexualized gestures as well as harassment, teasing, taunting or making threats.</p>

<p>Spreading rumours about a person’s gender identity or unwanted disclosure of someone’s gender identity is also a form of bullying.</p>

<h2>Sexual Bullying</h2>

<p>Sexual bullying can be actions that are harmful and humiliating. It can consist of sexual name-calling, vulgar gestures, crude comments, touching without permission, propositioning, as well as issues relating to some pornographic material. A bully might make a comment about a person’s sexual development or activity. In extreme cases sexual bullying can lead to sexual assault.</p>

<h2>Sexist Bullying</h2>

<p>Sexist bullying is where you are bullied because of your gender and can happen to both men and women. It generally occurs when someone has stereotypical ideals of what men and women’s roles should be. It normally occurs because men believe that women are subordinate and relates to the heteronormative principles of society. Sexism can be quite pervasive and difficult to pin point. It can also be connected to sexual bullying.</p>

<h2>Homophobic bullying</h2>

<p>Homophobic bullying can include all the above methods of bullying and that is done to you because of your sexual orientation, or perceived sexual orientation. Homophobic bullying can happen if you have relations with someone of the same sex/gender. This kind of bullying could also happen if you do not fit into the stereotypical roles of men or women, for instance if you are more feminine or masculine than some of society believes you should be. In this way homophobic bullying can be gender related.</p>
