					<h2>How to gain the appearance of a flat chest</h2>

<p>Here are some tips on how you can have the appearance of a flat chest:</p>

<p>•   Wear a few layers.</p>

<p>•   Button up shirts with t shirts underneath.</p>

<p>•   Darker clothes hide lumps.</p>

<p>•   If you can’t get a binder use compression sports bras.</p>

<p>•   If it’s the summer and you don’t have a binder, wear loose and thin button up shirts over t shirts.</p>

<p>•   Don’t use Ace bandages or duct tape to bind they can be very dangerous.</p>

<p>•   When it’s not too hot zip up (quite thick) jackets are good.</p>

<p>•   Waistcoats are good but only when a good size for your body so try them on before.</p>

<h2>Binding</h2>

<p>Binding is a way to make your chest look flatter. But it’s not for everyone.</p>

<p>DO NOT bind with bandages or duct tape. They are not designed for chest binding. Binding with bandages and duct tape can lead to injury and dangerously restrict your breathing and ribcage.</p>

<p>Find a good binder that you can wear under a t shirt or vest by Googling, searching ‘FTM binder’ on Ebay or see below for a few suppliers:</p>

<h2>Keeping cool</h2>

<p>In the summer, it can be difficult to stay cool if you want to have the appearance of a flat chest. To feel comfortable, you might feel the need to wear several layers of clothes. There is clothing out there to help with your gender presentation when the sun heats up. Here are a few tips for keeping cool.</p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>Keep hydrated - try to drink 2 litres per day. Wear sun cream - protect your skin from UVA and UVB rays that can cause skin cancer.  Stay in the shade between 12 noon and 3 pm if it’s very hot. Wear a hat to keep the sun off your face</p>

<h2>Swimming and Swimwear</h2>

<p>It is possible to find swimwear if you haven’t had or don’t want lower surgery.</p>

<p>A skirted swimsuit or skirter bikini bottoms can be a comfortable option. Google ‘skirted swimsuit’, ‘skirted bikini bottoms’ or ‘swim skirt’ to find a range of options from different mainstream shops</p>

<p>If you want to go swimming but you have to wear a binder or you are self-conscious about chest surgery scars, try a rash guard. Plenty of people like surfers wear rash guards to protect their skin from sunburn and sea water. Search ‘rash guard’ on Ebay or ask in your local sports shop.</p>
