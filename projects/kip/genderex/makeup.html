<p><strong>Make-up Tips for Trans Women</strong></p>

<p>A quick guide from a GI youth group member:</p>

<p>One key focus could be covering the 5 o’clock shadow in the beard area. This can be hard to do with minimal make-up.</p>

<p>You may be able to use foundation from a high street drugs store such as <a href="http://www.boots.com/en/Beauty/Make-up/Face/Foundation/">Boots</a>, but you may need something with strong coverage. A lot of trans girls use <a href="http://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/643/3894/Product-Catalog/Makeup/Face/Foundations/Double-Wear/Stay-in-Place-Makeup-SPF-10">Estee Lauder’s Double Wear</a> or <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/product/shaded/158/4386/Products/Face/Foundation/Studio-Sculpt-SPF-15-Foundation/index.tmpl">MAC’s studio sculpt</a>. Others use <a href="http://www.extrememakeup.co.uk/Kryolan-TV-Paint-Stick">Kryolan TV foundation sticks</a>, because, as the name indicates, it's make-up for TV and theatre, so it’s much thicker and fuller coverage than normal foundations. This means it’s able to conceal a beard shadow more effectively.</p>

<p>For lighter skin <a href="https://us.kryolan.com/product-lines/dermacolor">Derma Colour</a> (a dark orange coloured camoflauge crème) can be used to colour correct the blue undertone of a 5 O’clock shadow and cancel out the darkness of that area.</p>

<p>If you are a person of colour, some make up brands fall short of providing a wide range of suitable shades. This <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/foundation-dark-skin-tones#slide">article</a>, and another <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/advice/a18876/foundations-for-dark-skin/">here</a>,feature some foundation brands that offer a better range of darker tones. If you are looking for full coverage, you might want to test out a brand in advance.</p>

<p>If you have undergone laser hair removal treatment, which removes facial hair, you may wish to use less product, and high street foundation.</p>
