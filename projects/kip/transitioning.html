<h2>Transitioning</h2>

<p>Transitioning is an important word for trans people. It can mean taking the journey from your assigned sex/gender to the one you feel yourself to be or feel more comfortable expressing. Often trans people talk about socially transitioning. This means taking the steps such as changing your name, pronoun, clothes, haircut and other aspects of your appearance. It can also encompass undergoing medical intervention. You could say that the first step of a personâ€™s transition is to come out, and before that perhaps we have to <a href="comingout.html">come out to ourselves</a> first.</p>

<p>Other parts of transitioning include:</p>
