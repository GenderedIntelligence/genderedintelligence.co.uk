<h2>Applying to be a panellist at Imagining our Futures 2020</h2>

<p>Hearing from trans adults on our panel at Imagining Our Futures can completely turn around the way young trans people think about their future at work and their ideas about future families.</p>

<p><strong>Work</strong></p>

<p>We are looking for trans/non-binary/gender diverse adults from diverse backgrounds to volunteer to speak on a panel about their experiences of working or pursuing their interests. We are aiming for a range of work backgrounds as we know that trans people work across all sectors. We also welcome panellists to talk about experiences that are not based on paid employment, for example volunteering or activism. Please find the form to apply to be a panellist for our Work event

<p><strong>Families</strong></p>

<p>We are looking for trans/non-binary/gender diverse adults from diverse backgrounds to volunteer to speak on a panel about their experiences around everything to do with their family, whether that be them and their dog, a trans man who's had a baby, or a group of trans people who consider themselves one big chosen family. We know that 'the traditional family' can serve as a beautiful template for trans people too, and are keen to see that represented well.  Please find the form to apply to be a panellist for our Families event
