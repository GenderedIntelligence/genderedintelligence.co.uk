<h2>Collective Resilience - 18-30 therapy group</h2>

<p>The Gendered Intelligence therapeutic group for trans, gender diverse and questioning adults aged 18-30.</p>

<p>This 8 week program offers you the space to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Experience a supportive group of trans and gender diverse people <br></li>
<li>Connect with peers and build on your relationship skills <br></li>
<li>Reflect on your important identities and how they create your world  <br></li>
<li>Explore how you feel about yourself and - - what could help you to feel more confident and practice more self-love <br></li>
<li>Feel heard by your peers. Find/re-find your voice <br></li>
<li>Think outside of a label, try on labels, make new ones <br></li>
<li>Find ways to feel stronger in the world <br> </li>
</ul>

<p>We hope to live out these aims by using a therapeutic approach informed by the ideas of systemic psychotherapy, feminist and trans feminist therapies, liberation psychology, intersectionality and kindness.  We centralise community practices and the development of wisdom from an insider perspective, particularly how we can hold tight to our strengths and make our worlds more peaceful and beautiful.</p>

<p>We hope the Gendered Intelligence therapy group will allow members to connect to others, enabling a collective space that helps us to see how our lives echo each other’s and how our stories and experiences intersect with one another’s. Moving from being in conversation with ourselves or in our own heads to being in conversation with others can be transformative. This collective conversation is the priority of group.</p>

<p>We invite playfulness, defiance and curiosity as key tools for addressing the oppression and medicalisation of trans and gender diverse people lives and enabling greater individual and collective resilience.</p>

<p>At GI we use the term ‘trans’ to describe the spectrum of people who feel their assigned gender at birth does not feel right for them. It includes other terms such as transgender, transsexual, non-binary, gender variant, gender non-conforming, gender fluid and cross dresser. We also take care to ensure that people who are questioning their gender identity are also included in the work that we do.</p>
