<h1>Camping 2021 Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Q: What happens on camp?</h2>

<p>
   On camp you can expect a range of activities and games to get involved with,
   such as art, journaling and exploring nature. All this, plus sharing round
   campfires, cooking and eating as a community and living in a trans-only space
   for 3 days.
</p>

<h2>
   Q: I really want to come on camp, but I can’t attend the prep day, can I
   still come?
</h2>

<p>
   The camp prep day is a really important part of camp. It’s the day you meet
   everyone else who is coming, sort out who you might be sharing a tent with,
   meet your youth workers, and get to know more about what to expect. It’s also
   a good practice run of making the journey to London (particularly after a
   year where most of us have travelled less). If you don’t come on the prep
   day, you won’t be able to come on camp.
</p>

<h2>
   Q: Wait, the age ranges say 11-17 and 16-26. Is this a mistake? Which camp do
   I go on if I’m 16 or 17?
</h2>

<p>
   In 2019 we asked 16 and 17 year olds whether they wanted to be part of the
   younger or the older camp. We had mixed replies! So, if you are 16/17 you get
   to choose. Please tell us which you would prefer, or if you don’t mind.
</p>

<h2>Q: What about Covid? How will you make sure it’s safe?</h2>

<p>
   Guidance will be clearer by August and we will be able to give a more
   detailed answer on the prep day (which will take place outside if necessary).
   However, for now, we can tell you the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      We will be ensuring frequent hand-washing and sanitizing, especially
      during activities.
   </li>

   <li>
      We will be working hard to maintain social distancing (prepare for some
      LARGE circles!)
   </li>

   <li>
      This year we will be using a site where we can have an inside kitchen to
      help ensure easier cleaning.
   </li>

   <li>
      Use of masks in indoor spaces and possibly outdoors when close together
      (such as when putting up tents)
   </li>

   <li>
      Unless guidance states otherwise, people will not share sleeping sections
      in a tent.
   </li>

   <li>
      Requesting that everyone (young people and workers) carry out a lateral
      flow test prior to travelling to Prep day or camp and possibly on the
      final day of camp.
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Q: I’m worried about sharing a tent…</h2>

<p>
   We know that, as trans people, it can be a scary prospect to share a tent
   with others. On GI camp, we prioritise tents with separate sleeping areas.
   Due to covid, it is highly likely that everyone will have either their own
   tent, or their own sleeping area this year.
</p>

<h2>Q: How much does it cost?</h2>
<p>
   We know how important camp is, this year more than ever. So, this year camp
   is completely free for everyone. You will just need to pay for your travel
   (and we can reimburse you up to £7 for each journey). If you cannot afford
   your travel, please talk to us about how we can help.
</p>

<h2>
   Q: It’s amazing camp is available at no cost, but I’d like to make a donation
   for future camps, can I do this?
</h2>
<p>
   Absolutely! Thank you for helping future camps to happen. There are a few
   ways you can do this.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      Buy some camp merch from our
      <a href="https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/gi-store/"
         ><strong>Spreadshirt shop</strong></a
      >
      – profits go into our residential funding pot!
   </li>
   <li>
      Donate on <a href="/support-us/donate"><strong>our website</strong></a
      >. Just add in your comment that you’d like the money to go towards camp.
   </li>
</ul>
<h2>Q: I don’t have any camping equipment. I guess I can’t come?</h2>
<p>
   Incorrect! We have plenty of stuff you can borrow. Nobody has to bring their
   own tent and we have plenty of sleeping bags and sleeping mats for people who
   need them.
</p>
<h2>
   Q: I have some access needs (physical or mental health related) which might
   make camp difficult for me, I guess I can’t come?
</h2>
<p>
   Talk to us about this! Let’s see what we can figure out together. We have
   supported young people to attend camp before with plenty of different access
   needs. Email:
   <a href="mailto:youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk"
      ><strong>youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</strong></a
   >
</p>
<h2>Q: I have medication that I take, what do I do with this on camp?</h2>
<p>
   Medication (apart from epi-pens and asthma pumps) is held by a worker who is
   your Team Lead. You will be told who they are and will know where you can
   find them. They can also support you if you need help remembering your
   medication. This approach helps ensure medication doesn’t get lost and that
   nobody takes the incorrect medication.
