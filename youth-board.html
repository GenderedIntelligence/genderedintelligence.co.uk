					<h2>GI is setting up a Youth Board</h2>

<p><strong>We want to hear your voice.
We want you to help us make decisions across all GI’s services.
We want you to help guide us forward as a charity.</strong></p>

<h2>What is a youth board?</h2>

<p>The GI Board is a group of adults who volunteer to make sure GI keeps to important
rules. They help GI make decisions and help remind us of our aims and hopes if we ever
lose track. They also get a say in what rules are made at GI and how money is spent.
The Youth Board will discuss the same subjects as the GI board, but we will do so in
energetic, fun and creative ways.</p>

<p>The Youth Board will aim to meet 3-4 times a year. The meetings are open for GI
young people from age 8-30. For young people who attend our groups in London, Leeds
and Bristol. We want to hear from all of you! You don’t have to commit to attending
every Board meeting in the year.</p>

<p>After each Youth Board meeting, 2 young people will volunteer to attend the GI Board
meeting to ensure your voices get carried forward.</p>

<p>Each Youth Board event is supported by a team of GI youth workers and youth work
volunteers.</p>

<p>The next Youth Board meeting will be on <strong>Friday 13th November, 18:30 - 20:30</strong> on Zoom.</p>

<p>Email <strong>youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</strong> to sign up or if you have any questions.</p>

<p><strong>Please note, in light of the current situation and until further notice, all GI youth groups and youth service events will be held online.</strong></p>
