<h2>Announcing extended hours and our new NHS partner, the Sheffield Porterbrook clinic</h2>

<p>We are pleased to announce that our <a href="projects/supportline.html">Support Line</a> is extending opening hours to 5 days a week to better support patients at this difficult time. The Support Line is now offering support to gender care patients at our new NHS partner Sheffield Porterbrook Clinic, while continuing support services at the Nottingham Centre for Transgender Health. The service is available to gender questioning people who are either on the waiting list or current patients of gender services based at these clinics.</p>

<p>Gender diverse patients are currently facing a difficult time with the postponements in access to full gender care services and primary care, as an impact of the COVID-19 crisis public health strategy. Plus many in our gender diverse communities are also experiencing personal difficulties with the impact of self-isolation, the loss of services, employment and income. You may be experiencing anxiety, stress and have your own very individual personal concerns.</p>

<p>We would like to offer you support.  We can explore together the range of LGBTQI remote services on offer. We can talk with you, offering you a confidential supportive space. We do not need to ask you or record your personal details. We are here to talk (and message), to offer you support you with your gender transition, your gender healthcare concerns, and to support you in your wider wellbeing as a gender diverse person. Do feel free to make contact with us or to pass on our details to someone that might need us.</p>

<h2>Trans Inclusive Residentials - new guidance</h2>

<p><strong>Trans Inclusive Residentials: A Free Resource for Youth Workers, Schools and Organisations</strong></p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence has released <a href="/static/images/2019/10/17/14-03-31-GI_youth_residential_INTERACTIVE.pdf">new guidance</a> to support youth workers, community workers and staff in educational settings to run residentials that are inclusive of young trans people.</p>

<p>Based on 10 years’ experience of running residentials for young trans people, we want to share the key knowledge and advice developed by our youth workers over a decade.</p>

<p>The guidance covers a wide range of areas from changing facilities and sleeping arrangements, to outdoor activities, offsite visits, residentials abroad and how to support young people once the residential has come to an end.</p>

<p>This guidance is aimed at youth workers, community workers and staff in educational settings who are likely to be running residential trips.</p>

<p>However, it may also be a valuable resource for staff working on residential sites, parents/carers of young trans people and anyone else who is considering how to run or support a trans-inclusive residential.</p>

<p>You can download a PDF version of the guidance below.</p>
