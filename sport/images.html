<p>Any organisation seeking to be trans inclusive is welcome to download as many of these images as they wish.  However, if other organisations want copies, please signpost them to this page rather than passing the images on directly.  Tracking the number of downloads helps us get an idea of how much they are used and influences whether we invest in more!</p>
