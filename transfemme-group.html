					<h2>Transfemme Group for trans women, trans girls and transfeminine people aged 13-25</h2>

<p><body></p>

<p><strong>Please note, in light of the current situation and until further notice, all GI youth groups and youth service events will be held online</strong></p>

<p>Transfemme group, aka “Young gender nonconforming/transgender women or non binary humans living between the north &amp; south poles of the planet Earth (YNGTWNHLBN&amp;SPOFPE)” is Gendered Intelligence’s youth group for trans women, trans girls and non-binary people who are transfeminine aged 13-25.</p>

<p>The session runs on the first Wednesday of each month. Meetings are <strong>6.00 - 8.00pm</strong> and take place online. 
<br><br>
The group is dedicated to self-identifying trans women, trans girls and transfeminine young people only. All workers, volunteers and visitors identify as transfeminine or as trans women. If you’re unsure if this is the right group for you, email <a href="mailto:youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk">youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a>
<br><br>
We acknowledge that because of transmisogyny young trans women and transfeminine people sometimes experience additional difficulties. This group is designed to be a safe space for anyone who would benefit from being around other trans women, girls and transfeminine non-binary people. We believe that there’s no such thing as not being ‘trans enough’ or ‘feminine enough’. You are welcome to join the group as you are, no matter what pronouns you use, what clothes you wear, what name you use or how long you have identified as transfeminine.
