<p>As many of you will know we had to cancel our residentials this summer. We were especially sad as 2020 marks 10 years of GI camp. But we will not be defeated! Instead, we bring you GI Digi Resi: A residential in your residence!</p>

<p>Digi Resi will take place on Zoom. Youth workers will be present in all spaces at all times.</p>

<p>The Celebration day is open to people aged 11+ who have been on a GI resi before. The activities will be split by age on this day - 11-15, 16-25 and 18+. The open mic on the 8th, which is only open to those aged 16+.</p>

<p>Young people aged 14 or under will require consent from a parent/carer to attend, as will young people aged 15 who have never been to GI before.</p>

<p>There is an online <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeh8M7c9sgleO3zSv5RNGfXo-OgV6Hctsih8_2n9Q-Gb7nhPg/viewform">booking form</a> for young people which they need to complete to book by 12:30PM Monday 03 August 2020.

<h2>2020 Gendered Intelligence Summer Camp cancelled</h2>

<p><strong>Hey there, we know that if you're on this page it's because you're hoping to sign up to GI Camp</strong></p>

<p>In light of the uncertainties we are facing during the pandemic, we have made the difficult decision of cancelling this year's summer camps. We know how important camp is for you so we wanted to create a space to chat about how you are feeling and how we can best support you this year.</p>

<p>If you would like to talk about summer camps please email us at youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</p>

<p><strong>What the young trans people thought about our camping trip:</strong> <br></p>

<p>"<em>I learnt a lot and had so much fun for the first time in a long time. I didn't want to leave, it was like a little piece of paradise. I can't wait until the next one!</em>" - Youth group member  <br> <br>
"<em>Camp was a place I could be myself, a place where I didn’t worry about gender or the world outside, a place to forget about my problems for 4 days</em>" - Youth group member  <br> <br>
"<em>I really enjoyed archery, but what I liked best was just hanging out and chatting by the camp fire each night</em>." - Youth group member  <br><br>
"<em>It was muddy, but still fantastic</em>!" - Youth group member  <br><br>
"<em>I wish every day was camp!</em>" - Youth group member  <br><br>
"<em>I made some really good friends on camp and now feel less alone in the world.</em>” - Youth group member <br> <br></p>
