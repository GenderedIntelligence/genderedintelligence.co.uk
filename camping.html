<h2>Bookings will open on Monday 25th of April</h2>

Our summer camp booking will be going live on <strong>Monday 25th April at 6pm!</strong> It will be open for <strong>three weeks.</strong>

<p>This year our camps will be:</p>
<p><strong>11-17 year olds 12 - 15th August</strong> (Saturday 2nd July prep day, you must attend prep day to attend camp)</p>
<p><strong>16-26 year olds 22nd  - 25th July</strong> (Saturday 25th June prep day, you must attend prep day to attend camp)</p>

<p>Camps are at no cost to young people. However, donations are very welcome and will contribute to costs of future residentials.</p>

<p>This year booking will primarily be <strong>first come first served.</strong> We have 35 spaces available for both camps. 10 spaces will be reserved for people who have not been camping with us before. We will also reserve a minimum of 7 spaces for trans people of colour, and a minimum of 7 spaces for transfeminine young people at each camp.</p> 

<p>We know that booking a space can feel stressful to many and young people often ask for what information they need to have at hand when booking. <strong>Here’s what you need:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Basic information (name, email, date of birth, age on camp, address, which camp you’d like to attend)</li>
  <li>Health, medical and access needs (what medication you will bring with you to camp, underlying medical conditions, allergies, GP name and postcode, dietary needs, access needs)</li>
  <li>Emergency contact & legal guardian (name and address of parent/legal guardian, two emergency contacts and their phone number)</li>
  <li>What are you hoping to gain from camp or what you are hoping it will be like</li></ul>
<br><br>

<p>We know that the past few years have been really hard and we would take everyone on camp if we could. <strong>We are currently working hard to build even more residentials and other opportunities for young trans, non-binary and gender-questioning people across the UK.</strong></p>

<p>If you have any worries, questions or concerns, please talk to a youth worker, or email us on: <a href="mailto:youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk">youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a></p>

<p><strong>The booking form will be available

"<em>I really enjoyed archery, but what I liked best was just hanging out and chatting by the camp fire each night</em>." - Youth group member  <br><br>
"<em>It was muddy, but still fantastic</em>!" - Youth group member  <br><br>
