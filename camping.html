<h2>GI Camps 2022 – Information</h2>

<h2>Camp Bookings have now been closed</h2>

<p>This year our spaces filled up more quickly than ever so we had to close booking much earlier than we had originally planned. By midnight on the first day of booking we had already received over 100 applications.</p>

<p>This goes to show how necessary and important spaces like GI camp are. We are very committed to working hard and creating even more camps and other residentials in the coming years.</p>
  
<p>This is a process which involves training up staff, upskilling volunteers and finding the right campsites. You all deserve spaces where you can feel safe, held and understood.</p>

<h2>Waiting to hear</h2>

<p>Many of you are waiting to hear if you got a space or not. We know how stressful and difficult this wait can be. We will let you know as soon as we can and definitely within two weeks. Meanwhile we are also thinking hard about what other sort of opportunities we can give to those young people who will not get a space.</p> 

<p>We know that the past few years have been really hard and we would take everyone on camp if we could. <strong>We are currently working hard to build even more residentials and other opportunities for young trans, non-binary and gender-questioning people across the UK.</strong></p>

<p>Stay connected, come to groups, and let us know if you’re feeling worried or concerned. If you're new to GI, that applies to you too. Reach out, get in touch. Your youth workers are here for you.</p>

<p>Love and solidarity</p>

<p>If you have any worries, questions or concerns, please talk to a youth worker, or email us on: <a href="mailto:youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk">youthwork@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a></p>
