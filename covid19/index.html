<h2>Organisation-wide update</h2>

<p>To anyone using GI's Youth Work, Work in Education, Professional or Volunteer Services.</p>

<p>In line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults">Government advice</a>, our offices are now closed, but staff will be working from home and will be available.  All youth groups and sessions are cancelled for the next month.  Our face-to-face training sessions and consultancy work is being postponed, but you can find up to date information on our new <a href="../onlinecourses.html">E-learning and Remote Delivery page</a>. If you have booked with us, we will be in touch to re-schedule.</p>

<p>We are monitoring the changing situation and exploring ways to deliver our services remotely, in order to continue to support organisations and individuals. Our Volunteer service has already moved to remote delivery and will be holding an online induction in the near future. In the current situation our priority is to keep staff, service users and clients safe and healthy, and we would recommend that everyone keeps up to date with <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">NHS advice</a>.</p>
