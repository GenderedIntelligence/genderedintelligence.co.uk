<h2>Our Work in Schools and Colleges</h2>

<p>At Gendered Intelligence, we’re sometimes asked about the approach we take to working with young people in schools and colleges.  In this context, ‘young people’ means students under 18, with a particular focus on those under 16.
This includes our work with general student populations through <a href="../professionals/schools-and-youth-services/creative-workshops.html">workshops and assemblies</a> and our work with young trans and gender questioning people through <a href="../professionals/mentoring.html">mentoring</a>.</p>

<p>We want all teaching and pastoral staff to have a clear understanding of how we work, and hence gain confidence in what we do.</p>

<p>Shaping everything we do in our work in schools and colleges is our belief that <strong>every young person should be respected, supported and enabled to thrive, whoever they are, whoever they become and whatever age they are</strong>.
Everything we do comes back to this fundamental point.</p>

<p>Below are some short videos setting out the key approaches and messages that we embed in our educational work, and that are also reflected in our wider youth work.  The two people you’ll see in the videos are Simon, our Director of Professional and Educational Services, and Finn, our Director of Youth and Communities Work. Of course, whatever session we deliver, we take an age-appropriate approach. For example, sessions for key stage one might typically involve talking about identities, families and relationships, whilst sessions for year 6 onwards might, depending on the session / area of the curriculum, involve talking about puberty, bodies and sex.</p>

<p>Our work supports schools to fulfil their <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jcBStqjS6c2PrDtnyscZn6zLKmEfs_9Y/view?usp=sharing">duties and responsibilities</a> both towards young trans people, and towards their peers. And we’ve listed some <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pWiWbsRuX-nH-b7-ZMZW1czJ1tcvaMr_/view?usp=sharing">further resources</a> for you too, including the references for the statistics we use. We are always happy to answer any questions and provide more information to anyone considering booking a GI session for their school or college.</p>
