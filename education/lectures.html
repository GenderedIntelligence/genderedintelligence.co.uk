					<h2>Lectures, Presentations and Educational Workshops in Further Education Colleges and Higher Education Institutes</h2>

<p>Our Educational sessions can be carried out in any Further Education College or Higher Education Institute across England and Wales. They aim to engage learning around gender diversity and trans inclusion. We tailor lectures, presentations and workshops to particular courses, such as PGCE, sociology, psychology, journalism, nursing and applied theatre among others. In addition these educational sessions can contribute to ‘enrichment’ or ‘diversity’ events, LGBT History Month events and Student Union activities.</p>

<p>Lectures, Presentations and Educational Workshops in Further Education Colleges and Higher Education Institutes are useful in one or more of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>The institute’s ethos is committed to equality and inclusion, and would benefit from an increased understanding of gender diversity and what it means to include trans people</li>
<li>The institute wishes to prepare students for the opportunities, responsibilities and experience of later life and living in a diverse world</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the session students will show an increase in their ability to:
- Recognise and value diversity and prepare students for the world of work
- Respect difference and our responsibility to others in particular within our future roles as professionals
- Assertively challenge prejudice and discrimination
- Understand gender as diverse and the impact of gender stereotyping</p>

<strong>Cost</strong>:       £165 per hour (plus travel expenses)<br>
<strong>Numbers</strong>:    Up to 100 students  <br></p>
