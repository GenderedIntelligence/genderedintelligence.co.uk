Jay has been involved in the trans community since 2002. Since then, he’s been passionate about improving the lives of trans and gender questioning people, especially young people. In 2008, Jay co-founded Gendered Intelligence and have been involved in delivering all aspects of GI’s work at one time or another, including projects such as ‘What makes your gender? Hacking into the Science Museum’ – a £10,000 Heritage Lottery funded project in partnership with the Science Museum, and ‘GI’s Anatomy: a life drawing project for trans and intersex people’ – a £30,000 project funded by the Welcome Trust. In recent years he acted as an independent adviser to the Ministry of Justice review into the care and management of transgender offenders, and gave oral evidence to the Trans Inquiry for the Women and Equalities Select Committee. He now sits on the National Transgender Advisory Board for trans prisoners with the Ministry of Justice. He’s very enthusiastic about education and learning; his favourite subject is gender – there’s always more to discover.  In 2013 Jay gained his doctorate and has a range of publications in the area of Trans Studies.
