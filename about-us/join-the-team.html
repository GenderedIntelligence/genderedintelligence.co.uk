<p>Gendered Intelligence (GI) is a registered not-for-profit charity, established in 2008. Our mission is to increase understandings of gender diversity and to improve the lives of trans people. We work predominantly with the trans community and those who impact on trans lives; we particularly specialise in supporting young trans people aged 8-30.</p>

<h2>Join the team</h2>
<p>Gendered Intelligence consists of a team of skilled trainers, youth workers, mentors, public speakers, consultants, workshop facilitators and community practitioners, who are supported by individuals with administrative, finance, research, policy, communications and IT skills.  We have a working and in-depth knowledge of the wider trans community and of the young trans community in particular. </p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence is a trans-led organisation, which means most members of the team are trans. We feel strongly that there is not one way of being trans, and there are many different ways and approaches to help GI achieve its aims. </p>

<p>We are keen to ensure that collectively the team is diverse in order that we can draw from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives and styles of thinking and working. As the organisation grows this is more important than ever. </p>

<p><b>Trainer</b></p>
<p>We are looking for up to three experienced trainers to join our existing training team, delivering trans awareness and inclusion sessions to a wide range of audiences in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. The role of trainer at GI is a positive, professional and challenging one which has the ability to change the world we live in. We are keen to welcome new additions to the team who will contribute to that work, and who will also bring new perspectives to enable us to move forward, develop and remain at the forefront of trans inclusivity.</p>
<p><b>Salary:</b> £25,595-28,785 (+£3,000 London Weighting where applicable) pro rata per annum</p>
<p><b>Location:</b> Based from home, with a requirement to attend staff meetings and activities at GI’s London Office and to travel nationally. While almost all working is remote at present, we will return to face-to-face working when it is safe and appropriate to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Owing to the requirement to attend GI meetings and events in London, and to travel efficiently to clients, the postholder will need to be able to commute easily to London and to GI’s London office (currently at Kings Cross).</strong></p>
<p><b>Deadline to apply:</b> 9am on Monday 10th January 2022</p>
<p><b>Interviews:</b> Long-listed applicants will be informed by the end of Friday 14th January and called forward to deliver a 15 minute ‘microteach’. Short-listed applicants will be informed by the end of Monday 24th January and invited to take the administration/client liaison test and attend an interview. Successful applicants will be informed by the end of January.</p>

<p>We've provided a lot of information about the role itself, about the training team and about GI to help you decide if the role is for you.  This means there's quite a lot to read. To help you get started, we have provided a video for those who would prefer to watch the main introductory information rather than read it.  The video content is exactly the same as the written information in the "More About..." document and the first page of the pack.</p>
