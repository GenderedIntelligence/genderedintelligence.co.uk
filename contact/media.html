					<p>We are happy to receive media enquiries and will do our best to work with journalists across media formats.</p>

<p>As an organisation, we have a broad range of interests and knowledge relating to trans people in the UK and gender diversity more widely. Please find below a non-exhaustive list of subjects that we are happy to speak about:</p>

<ul>
<li>The day to day lives of trans people and the issues that affect them </li>
<li>Trans young people and children </li>
<li>Non-binary issues </li>
<li>Legislation and trans rights </li>
<li>Discrimination and hate crime </li>
<li>Sports and physical activity </li>
<li>Health, including mental health </li>
<li>Education, from primary school to higher education </li>
<li>Inclusion of trans people in public and cultural life </li>
<li>Media and representation</li>
<li>Trans and gender diverse actors in theatre, film and TV </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are looking to speak to a young trans person, please be aware that we consider the wellbeing of the children and young people we work with as a priority. It is highly unlikely that we would welcome filming in any of our youth spaces.</p>

<p>We are working with a group of parents and carers of trans and non-binary children and young people who are interested in speaking about the issues that affect them and their families.</p>

<p>Please send all media enquiries to: <a href="mailto:publicengagement@genderedintelligence.co.uk">publicengagement@genderedintelligence.co.uk</a></p>
