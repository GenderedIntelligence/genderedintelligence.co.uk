Jay has been involved in the trans community since 2002. Since then, he’s been passionate about improving the lives of trans and gender questioning people, especially young people. Jay co-founded Gendered Intelligence in 2008 and has since been involved in delivering GI’s work at one time or another, including projects such as ‘What makes your gender? Hacking into the Science Museum’ – a £10,000 Heritage Lottery funded project in partnership with the Science Museum, and ‘GI’s Anatomy: a life drawing project for trans and intersex people’ – a £30,000 project funded by the Wellcome Trust. In recent years he acted as an independent adviser to the Ministry of Justice review into the care and management of transgender offenders, and gave oral evidence to the Trans Inquiry for the Women and Equalities Select Committee. He now sits on the National Transgender Advisory Board for trans prisoners with the Ministry of Justice. He’s very enthusiastic about education and learning; his favourite subject is gender – there’s always more to discover.  In 2013 Jay gained his doctorate and has a range of publications in the area of Trans Studies.<br>

  <div id="Chryssy" class="collapse">
    
Chryssy has a research background in equality and diversity. Her research has focused on the impact of the Equality Act 2010 on the lives of the most marginalised, centring the lives of trans and sexgender nonconforming people, and drawing on her own lived experience as a trans woman. Chryssy brings this experience to her work with GI and the Board. Chryssy is also active in work with LGBTQ+ prisoners with the Bent Bars Project, and helped set up TAGS for trans and sexgender nonconforming swimmers.<br><br>

Chryssy facilitated a workshop on prison abolition at the GI Supercamp and gave a paper at the Transforming Spaces Conference about the politics of trans prisoners. Outside of GI Chryssy works in the LGBTQ charity sector for Opening Doors London, helping over 50s in our communities overcome isolation and loneliness.<br><br>

Chryssy feels that living overseas on three continents for 10 years has given her some appreciation of the lives of others and a different perspective on the privileges and challenges of our lives in the UK, especially as a trans woman in these uncertain and seemingly disenfranchised times. Chryssy is also a proud parent.
