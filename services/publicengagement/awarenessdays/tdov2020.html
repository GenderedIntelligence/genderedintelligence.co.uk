<h2>7 ways to be an ally this Trans Day of Visibility</h2>

<h2>#1 Pronouns pronouns pronouns!</h2>

<p>Add your pronouns to your email signature and social media profiles. Normalise the conversation. The way we use language is so important that it can mean inclusion or exclusion. Including your pronouns in your email signature and social media is an easy step to take – and it has a big impact. It normalises this as a standard practice that applies to everyone, so that trans people are not singled out. It will show you understand getting pronouns right is an important part of respecting and acknowledging people’s identity and that you are committed to trans equality.</p>

<h2>#2 Factor trans young people into your consideration about child and human rights</h2>

<p>Child rights are human rights. It might be obvious, but this is key for young trans people to be appropriately protected under the law. Young trans people exist and should be visible and represented in legislation and human rights frameworks.  Have a look at our <a href="support/families-resources.html">resources for families</a> to learn more about existing legislation and how it protects young trans people.</p>

<p>Our Youth Service has had to adapt to the covid-19 crisis to reach our young users. The video below describes what we’re doing and how you can help:</p>

<h2>#3 Support trans-led organisations and projects!</h2>

<p>Donate time, money and resource to services working for trans people:  now more than ever, with young trans people stuck at home (often with unsupportive families), you can keep vital youth services running by <a href="support-us/donate.html">donating money</a>, or <a href="support-us/volunteer.html">your time and resources</a>. Here are also a couple of amazing services you can support:</p>

<p>QueerCare is a transfeminist autonomous care organisation, providing training, support and advocacy for trans and queer people in the UK. Their model has been framing the system used by many COVID19 Mutual Aid groups which are currently supporting thousands of people during the pandemic.  You can sign up to help out through their <a href="https://queercare.network/help-out/">website</a>.</p>

<p>Outside Project  - <a href="https://www.goldengiving.com/secure/donation/the-outside-project?appealUid=7440f8a2-1f7c-4479-810a-3c48231a6574&amp;amount=10.00">Donate to the Outside Project Emergency Hotel - COVID19 Appeal</a>. They have been working with the YHA in Central London to open an emergency hotel and will provide emergency housing and support to the LGBTIQ+ community for the next 3 months.  You can also share the appeal with others on Twitter.</p>

<h2>#4 Join our GIANTS network and clap back at transphobia</h2>

<p><a href="projects/GIANTS.html">GIANTS</a> is Gendered Intelligence Activists’ Network &amp; Trans Spokespersons.  GIANTS aims to equip a self-organised community of gender diverse people with the skills to advocate for their own inclusion and the capacity to create sustained community spaces.  Being part of GIANTS means you can be part of monthly meetings and quarterly training to continue skills development. You can join by filling in the <a href="https://forms.gle/MfkxN5q9jCrJNcZp6">application  form</a>, or email  giants@genderedintelligence.co.uk  for any questions.</p>

<h2>#5 Learn about the importance of an intersectional understanding of ‘trans’ as a class issue, a race issue, a disability issue.</h2>

<p>Being trans is not only about gender. Intersectionality shows the disproportionate ways in which trans people experience system of privilege and oppression. The ways in which gender, race, class and disability interrelate can mean a huge difference in terms of the amount of discrimination and barriers that a trans person faces. Learning more about what this means in practice can go a long way in changing your behaviours and practices and making them more inclusive. You could start by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=93&amp;v=u2RrcIOJ7BU&amp;feature=emb_logo">this video from Juno Roche</a> and <a href="https://mygenderation.com/">My Genderation</a> talking about stigma and invisibility of trans people who have HIV.</p>

<h2>#6 Share your love of the trans people in your life</h2>

<p>Visibility doesn’t always translate into more protection, as it can be extremely unsafe for trans people to be visible (just think about receiving an incredible amount of digital harassment for simply existing). That’s why it’s important for trans allies to support and celebrate trans people so that it will become safer to be visible and represented. It shouldn’t have to sit on trans people’s shoulders. We've created <a href="ilove.html">a series of pictures</a> you can share to show how dear the trans people in your life are to you! (but make sure you have their consent to share anything publicly).</p>

<h2>#7 Give money to trans creatives!</h2>

<p>The covid-19 crisis means that many trans creatives – often excluded from the workforce through institutional transphobia – are having to rely on unsteady or disappearing incomes all the more.  Here are some incredible trans artists you can support:</p>
