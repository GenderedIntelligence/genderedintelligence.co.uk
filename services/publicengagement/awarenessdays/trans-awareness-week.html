Jay has been involved in the trans community since 2002. Since then, he’s been passionate about improving the lives of trans and gender questioning people, especially young people. Jay co-founded Gendered Intelligence in 2008 and has since been involved in delivering GI’s work at one time or another, including projects such as ‘What makes your gender? Hacking into the Science Museum’ – a £10,000 Heritage Lottery funded project in partnership with the Science Museum, and ‘GI’s Anatomy: a life drawing project for trans and intersex people’ – a £30,000 project funded by the Wellcome Trust. In recent years he acted as an independent adviser to the Ministry of Justice review into the care and management of transgender offenders, and gave oral evidence to the Trans Inquiry for the Women and Equalities Select Committee. He now sits on the National Transgender Advisory Board for trans prisoners with the Ministry of Justice. He’s very enthusiastic about education and learning; his favourite subject is gender – there’s always more to discover.  In 2013 Jay gained his doctorate and has a range of publications in the area of Trans Studies.<br>

Moya started volunteering for GI in 2016, creating our Annual Report, and joined the team more formally in October 2018. As GI has grown massively since 2015, her role is to ensure appropriate systems and policies are in place so that colleagues can continue to deliver excellent services in a safe and productive environment. Moya is responsible for HR, Finance, Office Management, Compliance and Public Engagement. Prior to GI, Moya worked in the charity sector and Higher Education, in a wide variety of roles including Volunteer Management, Fundraising, Communications and International Business Development. She has been involved in the queer community since the 90s, and was founder and Chair of the LGBTQ & Friends network in her last workplace. Moya has been a cis ally for many years, attending GI events since our inception.
