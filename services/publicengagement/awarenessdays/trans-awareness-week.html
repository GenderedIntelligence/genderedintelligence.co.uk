Moya started volunteering for GI in 2016, creating our Annual Report, and joined the team more formally in October 2018. As GI has grown massively since 2015, her role is to ensure appropriate systems and policies are in place so that colleagues can continue to deliver excellent services in a safe and productive environment. Moya is responsible for HR, Finance, Office Management, Compliance and Public Engagement. Prior to GI, Moya worked in the charity sector and Higher Education, in a wide variety of roles including Volunteer Management, Fundraising, Communications and International Business Development. She has been involved in the queer community since the 90s, and was founder and Chair of the LGBTQ & Friends network in her last workplace. Moya has been a cis ally for many years, attending GI events since our inception.
