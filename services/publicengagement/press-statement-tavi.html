<h1>GENDERED INTELLIGENCE INTERVENOR IN <br>
APPEAL CASE ON PUBERTY BLOCKING TREATMENT</h1>



On Wednesday 23 and Thursday 24 June 2021, Gendered Intelligence will be intervening in the appeal being heard on the Bell v Tavistock case. The original judgment, released in December 2020, means that young trans  people currently seeking puberty delaying treatment are being obstructed from doing so, even where full capacity under Gillick competence exists. We have filed a joint submission to the Court of Appeal alongside our co-intervenors, Brook and the Endocrine Society, arguing that the previous ruling makes it more difficult for young people and their families to gain access to healthcare that is timely, age appropriate and of high quality. This action has been facilitated by the Good Law Project, a campaign organisation which uses the law to challenge abuses of power, inequality, and injustice.<br><br>

We have produced a position statement on ‘puberty delaying treatment’, which you can view here in advance of the hearing. This position statement has extensive footnotes with background information into puberty delaying treatments, as well as detailing our organisational understanding of the environment as it stands.<br><br>

In part, we believe:<br><br>
<ul><li>
All young people are entitled to timely, age appropriate, high quality healthcare under the NHS</li>
<li>Not all young trans, gender diverse and gender questioning young people will want to use puberty delaying treatment, but for those that do it can be highly valuable and life affirming.  Gendered Intelligence will continue to support all young people in pursuing their right to receive the healthcare that they are entitled to</li>

<li>We believe that young people should be at the front and centre of any decision making regarding their health, with the support and consent from parents/carers and under the supervision of an appropriate professional working in trans healthcare</li></ul>
<br><br><br>
 

 

We hope that this appeal will help clarify the role that Gillick competence must play in young people’s healthcare, and that where meaningful competence exists it cannot be ignored in favour of a court order. If we allow for Gillick to be undermined for young trans people, we set a dangerous precedent which may in turn be rolled out for all young people. Either Gillick competence exists or it does not – we cannot allow exceptions to be made for young trans people and their access to healthcare. A loss to trans youth is a loss to all - this is something we at Gendered Intelligence believe we must not allow.<br><br><br>

 

We must continue to allow healthcare experts to make the decisions which are best for the person in front of them without fear of censure. Gendered Intelligence will continue to support all young people in pursuing their right to receive the healthcare that they are entitled to, and which they have made rightful steps to autonomously access.

Puberty delaying treatment is also widely known as ‘puberty blockers’. This refers to GnRHa, which is a medication that delays physical puberty – the development of secondary sex characteristics.<br><br>

Gillick competence refers to a child or young person’s ability to meaningfully consent to advice and treatment. Gillick means that under 16s can consent if they have sufficient understanding and intelligence to fully understand what is involved in a proposed treatment.<br><br>
