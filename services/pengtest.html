	<h2>Introduction</h2>	
	This position paper sets out the position <a href="#one" title="open" data-click="true">Gendered Intelligence¹</a> takes on the matter of the assessing for, and the administering and monitoring of, <a href="#two" title="two" data-click="true">Puberty Delaying Treatment²</a> for young <a href="#three" title="three" data-click="true">trans³</a>, non-binary and gender diverse people.  
	<br><br>
At Gendered Intelligence we recognise a more appropriate expression for this treatment is ‘puberty delaying hormones’ as the treatment does not ‘block’ puberty permanently.  Rather, the treatment works to delay physical puberty in order to reduce distress caused by the feminisation or masculinization of secondary sex characteristics.  <br><br><h2>Background</h2>
	Over the last 2 years, Gendered Intelligence has held workshops with its staff members and Youth Board to consider what we as a team thought about ‘medical transitioning and young people.’ With so much in the public domain, the focus of our thinking was around puberty delaying treatment. Since then, we have seen the Judicial Review court case Tavistock vs Bell and Mrs A and Gendered Intelligence chose to intervene in <a href="#four" title="open" data-click="true">the Appeal⁴</a>. Consequently, WPATH made a joint statement with other jurisdictions about the treatment of adolescent trans people.  There was also a case in the family courts AB regarding parental consent.  This has given us an opportunity to engage more fully with the research and acknowledge the complexity of medical treatment for young trans, non-binary and gender diverse people. Some of the young people and their parents and carers who access our services have told us about the importance of puberty delaying treatment has on their everyday lives, as well as the ways in which the Judicial Review has impacted on them directly.    <br><br>
Staff at Gendered Intelligence have diverse views about medical transitioning, not least the emphasis society places on the medicalisation of trans people and ‘wrong body’ narratives, as well as considering political views around the pharmaceutical industry at large. At Gendered Intelligence we value the diversity of views. At the same time, we recognise a need to provide guidance and a framework for all staff to engage further with our young people, community members, clients and members of the general public.  This position paper therefore sets out our organisational view.<br><br>
	<h2>Gendered Intelligence Position statement</h2><br><br>
<ul>
	<li>• All young people are entitled to timely, age appropriate, high quality healthcare. </li>
	<li>• Not all young trans, gender diverse and gender questioning young people will want to administer puberty delaying treatment, but for those that do it can be highly valuable and life affirming.  Gendered Intelligence will continue to support all young people in pursuing their right to receive the healthcare that they are entitled to.</li>
	<li>• We stand behind current NHS protocol of offering puberty delaying treatment to those young people who are deemed to benefit from it and at the point that puberty has started.</li>
	<li>• We believe that young people should be at the front and centre of any decision making regarding their health, with the support and consent from parents/ carers and under the supervision of an appropriate professional in Gender Care Services.</li>
<li>• The principles of ‘informed consent’ discussed in adult trans health care should not exclude children and young people. The use of Gillick competence is a key root to empower young people to have agency over their healthcare</li>
	<li>• We understand that support and consent to puberty delaying treatment from parents and carers is appropriate and desired, but those young people who do not have the support of their parents and carers should not be left behind.</li>
		
		
<li>• -	Research tells us - and from working with young trans people for over 12 years, as well as from our own lived experiences as a trans led organisation - that supporting people with their social transition is most important. We also know that the best support comes from a place of understanding and that being educated about gender diversity is key to reaching that understanding.</li>
<li>• All transitions – medical and social – are unique to the individual. Young people need careful, kind and supportive environments and conversations that will help them make decisions that are right for themselves.</li>
<li>• Young people need access to the latest, up to date, accurate information, including the risks, to inform those decisions and they need to weigh up what is the right thing to do for themselves with the support from and alongside a wide-ranging set of trusted adults. </li>
<li>• We recognise that some people have more than one transition. This should not be judged negatively, instead support should be offered.</li>
<li>• Being trans is not a mental health condition and trans healthcare should not be framed as pathological</li>
<li>• We do not believe any child or young person should be restricted in expressing their gender, be it through names, pronouns and gender markers used; through clothes, hair styles and makeup; through behaviours and mannerisms or through hobbies, toys and interests.
<li>• Trans people should not be positioned as reinforcing gender norms if they go through a medical transition.
<li>• We seek to challenge gender norms and stereotypes and believe that gender diversity should be celebrated in society.</li>

                <p>Gendered Intelligence, established in 2008, is a registered charity that works to increase understandings of gender diversity and improve the lives of trans people. We are a trans-led and trans-involving grassroots organisation with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and an exemplary depth and breadth of trans community knowledge, backed with rigorous academic thinking and knowledge to PhD level.<br><br>
Gendered Intelligence imagines a world where people are no longer constrained by narrow perceptions and expectations of gender, and where diverse gender expressions are visible and valued.  We believe everyone can be intelligent about gender.<br><br>
Trans experiences provide a valuable lens through which we can examine our cultural perspective on gender, and we believe it enhances everyone’s life to open up more possibilities and options and remove unnecessary gender-based constraints. We work with trans communities and those who impact on trans lives; we particularly specialise in supporting young trans people aged 8-30. Our work aims to better trans lives through: the delivery of professional educational services such as trans awareness training and consultancy; a large youth service; a support line; mentoring in education; affecting public policy, working with the media and carrying out research; as well as many other projects and services.

            <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>‘Puberty blockers’ is the well-known term for GnRHa, which is a medication that delays puberty – the development of secondary sex characteristics. GnRA is administered to a small minority of young people who are experiencing significant distress due to ‘Gender Dypshoria’. The treatment for this group of individuals has been adopted since the mid-1990s and has also been used to treat young people with diagnosed precocious puberty since the 1970s. <br><br>
The effects of the treatment are reversible and are only prescribed to young people who have reached at least Tanner Stage two – i.e. puberty has started usually around the age of 11-13. <br><br>
Current estimates are that 400 young people in England and Wales are receiving puberty delaying treatment. <br><br>
Any young person receiving puberty delaying treatment will attend the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), which is a national psychological service for young people who experience ‘gender dysphoria’ or are questioning their gender identity throughout England and Wales. It is part of the Tavistock Trust and the service is commissioned by NHS England Specialised Services. Clinicians at GIDS are responsible for assessing young people and referring them to an endocrine team.  <br><br>
Endocrinologists are the practitioners who are responsible for supporting clients with decision making, administering and monitoring of puberty delaying hormones.
The National Health Service describes ‘Gender Dysphoria’ as “a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity” ( https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/).  <br><br>
Gender dysphoria is a clinical term that allows access to health care. Treatment options include counselling, puberty delaying treatment, gender affirming hormones, gender reassignment surgery. In order to gain legal recognition and to amend gender markers on UK passports, a person must have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Should they wish to, it will also allow trans people to transition legally through the GRA (when they are 18). Although not necessary, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria also supports a person’s social transition in their education, workplace and at home too as it lends legitimacy to their circumstances.  <br><br>
In Gender Dysphoria Services: A Guide for GPs and other Healthcare Staff (Apr 2013) it states: 
“It should be emphasised that Gender Dysphoria and Transsexualism are not considered, in and of themselves, mental illnesses in any essential sense. The associated pressures of unmanaged dysphoria and/or the social stigma that can accompany gender diagnosis and transition may, however, result in clinically significant levels of distress.” 
This statement recognises that being trans in and of itself does not cause poor mental health – it is society’s response that is the key factor. However, although life can be challenging and difficult for trans people, and that should not be dismissed or taken lightly, it is important not to cast trans people as victims. Many trans people can and do live positive, happy and fulfilled lives. That should be possible for everyone, and changing how we treat trans people, working towards full inclusion plays a major part in making that a reality.  <br><br>
In the article, “Is puberty delaying treatment ‘experimental treatment’?” Simona Giordano & Søren Holm state:
‘The treatment is not normally prescribed either to young children, or to those who identify as simply gender diverse, and is even less likely to be prescribed to those who might just be perceived as gender diverse by others. <br><br>
Not all children who have non-congruent gender expression also suffer dysphoria and there is significant variability in gender expression, both in cisgender children and transgender children (Gülgöz et al., 2019). Many cisgender children express behaviors that are perceived as gender non-congruent in the culture of belonging. These are not the children who would typically be treated medically. <br><br>
…
Since the mid 1990s, puberty delaying medications have been prescribed to some adolescents (not prepubertal children) with severe and persistent gender dysphoria, in cases in which such distress was aggravated by pubertal development

            <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>People who use the word trans include those who: <ul><li>Identify with the ‘opposite’ binary gender </LI>
<li>Have identities that are both male and female, neither male nor female or who have another sense of gender </li>
<li>Have a fluid gender identity and may move between different genders </li>
<li>May express different gender-related aspects of themselves at different times / places </li>
		    <li>Don’t experience a sense of gender </li><br><br>
There is a wide range of identities and approaches to gender which may involve being both male and female, or neither male nor female, or which take other approaches to gender that don’t align with traditional binary ideas. <br><br>
People with these experiences of gender sometimes use terms such as ‘non-binary’ (because their experiences fall outside the typical male / female ‘binary’ experiences) or ‘genderqueer’ to describe themselves. There are people who have a fluid gender identity and may move between different genders. They may use terms such as ‘gender fluid’. 
There are people who may express (through cultural cues such as clothing, name, speech, mannerisms etc) different gender-related aspects of themselves at different times or in different places. They may use terms such as ‘cross-dresser’ or ‘dual role’. And there are people who don’t experience a sense of gender, or very little sense of gender. They may use terms such as ‘agender’.

            <div class="collapsible-header" id="four">⁴ - Legal analysis</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
                <p>The following text has been provided by Simmons and Simmons as a legal analysis:<br>
<blockquote><i>‘Judicial review exists so that the way in which decisions are made by public bodies can be challenged to ensure that they comply with relevant procedures, regulations, laws and so on, in order that their decision-making process is fair. The Court does not consider the merits and / or outcome of the decision itself during judicial review. This means that even if a Court finds that a public body has come to a decision unlawfully, the outcome of that decision might not ultimately change as long as, when it is revisited, proper procedure is followed. <br><br>
Judicial reviews can be brought by any individual or organization that has sufficient interest in the decision or issue in question (referred to as proper “standing”). 
In October 2020 a Judicial Review was heard at the High Court Bell and Mrs A verses Tavistock. It centred on whether young people can meaningfully consent to the administering of puberty blockers.<br><br>
The Claimants brought this judicial review on two grounds:<br>
(A)	Children and young people under the age of 18 are not capable of giving valid informed consent to the administration of Puberty Blockers (PBs) (the “competence issue”). This was the Claimants’ primary case: that children and young people going through puberty are not capable of properly understanding the nature, effect and consequences of PBs, which they argued should be classed as an experimental treatment. <br>
(B)	The information given by Tavistock and the Trusts about PBs is misleading and inadequate to allow informed consent to be given (the “information issue”).
The Court did considered evidence about treatments available for Gender Dysphoria, however it was not being asked to rule on their appropriateness. Instead, as the Court stated: “The sole legal issue in the case is the circumstances in which a child or young person may be competent to give valid consent to treatment in law and the process by which consent to the treatment is obtained.”’</i></blockquote><br><br>
On Tuesday 1st December 2020, the High Court handed down its judgment stating that it is "highly unlikely those 13 and under would ever be Gillick competence to give consent to being treated with [puberty blockers]", that it's "highly doubtful" 14 and 15 year olds could sufficiently understand the long-term risks and consequences of treatment and whilst 16 year olds are presumed to be Gillick competent, the judgment stated that clinicians may wish to seek court approval before commencing treatment regardless. 
Following clinical protocol, families need to obtain a best interest order from the courts to seek permission to obtain puberty blockers. The judgement was declared ‘stayed’, which means current procedures could continue until the Tavistock have exhausted all options. <br><br>
Despite this, NHS England released their amendments to the service specification on the same day saying that a clinical review will assess if each client currently receiving PBs will be put forward to obtain a best interest court order. Decisions were made that there would be no new prescribing prior to the appeal. However, those in current treatment will continue to receive treatment. <br><br>
On 22nd December 2021 the Tavistock made an application to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  On 18th January 2021 that application was granted.  The Good Law Project – a group of legal experts  - launched a large-scale fund for trans-specific court cases and raised £130K. Some of that money has been used to support the application of an intervention on the appeal.  A coalition of relevant organisations Brook, the Endocrine Society and Gendered Intelligence applied and were granted permission to intervene in the appeal. 
An intervention is where third parties with an interest ask to be heard in a case – alongside the main parties. Intervenors are permitted by the Court to file evidence and / or make representations because they have an interest in, or may be affected by, the outcome. The Endocrine Society are the international body that advocates and affects policy for the practice of endocrinology and Brook are involved from the perspective of being experts around Gillick Competency.  GI is a trans-led organisation with over 12 years experience of delivering youth work practice to young trans and gender questioning people. As part of GI’s involvement in the coalition of intervenors we organised a crowd sourcing approach to gather all published evidence and findings that respond to the key points set out below. Thanks to National Trans Youth Network, Mermaids, the Proud Trust, the Trans Organisations Network at the LGBT consortium and key staff at Gendered Intelligence. See Add title and hyperlink for comprehensive bibliography. <br><br>
The appeal is to take place at the Royal Courts of Justice on 23rd and 24th June 2021. In an appeal no new evidence is allowed to be submitted but it is more about forming a legal argument. The judgment will be handed down either around end of July or October 2021.
