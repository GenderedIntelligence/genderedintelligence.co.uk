	This document is meant as an easy-read statement on our organisational stance around puberty delaying treatment. Footnotes containing detailed information and background are at the bottom of this page, and will appear when you click on relevant references throughout the statement.<br>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>	
	This statement paper sets out the position Gendered Intelligence<a href="#one" title="open" data-click="true">¹</a> takes on the matter of the assessing for, and the administering and monitoring of, <i>puberty delaying treatment</i><a href="#two" title="two" data-click="true">²</a> for young trans<a href="#three" title="three" data-click="true">³</a>, non-binary and gender diverse people.  
	<br><br>
While the term ‘puberty blockers’ is in common usage, at Gendered Intelligence we recognise a more appropriate expression for this treatment is ‘puberty delaying treatment’ as the treatment does not ‘block’ puberty permanently.  Rather, the treatment works to delay physical puberty in order to reduce distress caused by the feminisation or masculinisation of secondary sex characteristics.   <br><br><h2>Background</h2>
Over the last 2 years, Gendered Intelligence has held workshops with its staff members and Youth Board to consider what we as a team thought about ‘medical transitioning and young people.’ With significant focus on puberty delaying treatment in the public domain, our focus at Gendered Intelligence has gravitated here.  In October 2020, we have seen the High Court case <i><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2020/3274.html">Bell v Tavistock</a></i>. Gendered Intelligence chose to intervene in the Appeal to this case<a href="#four" title="open" data-click="true">⁴</a>. Following the <i>Bell v Tavistock outcome</i> outcome, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) formed a joint statement<a href="#five" title="open" data-click="true">⁵</a> with other organisations working across global jurisdictions about the treatment of adolescent trans people.  In March 2021, there was another case in the family courts regarding parental consent, which allowed for partial movement from the original Bell v Tavistock outcome<a href="#six" title="open" data-click="true">⁶</a>.  <br><br>


This has given us an opportunity to engage more fully with the research and acknowledge the complexity of medical treatment for young trans, non-binary and gender diverse people. Young people — and their parents and carers — who access our services have told us about the important impact puberty delaying treatment has had on their everyday lives, as well as the ways in which the Judicial Review has impacted on them directly<a href="#seven" title="open" data-click="true">⁷</a> <a href="#eight" title="open" data-click="true">⁸</a>.



Our stakeholders at Gendered Intelligence have diverse views about medical transitioning, not least concerning a misplaced emphasis from across mainstream platforms on the medicalisation of trans people and ‘wrong body’ narratives. There are also more political views held by some here at Gendered Intelligence about the pharmaceutical industry at large. At Gendered Intelligence we value this diversity of views, welcoming and engaging with a wide range of opinions. At the same time, we recognise a need to provide guidance and a framework for all staff and volunteers to engage further with our young people, community members, clients and members of the general public.  This position paper therefore sets out our shared organisational view. <br><br>
