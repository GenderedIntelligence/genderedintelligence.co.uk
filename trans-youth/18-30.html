<h2>Supportive social group for 18-30 year olds in London</h2>

<p><strong>Please note, all GI groups and youth service events will now take place in a mixture of in person and online settings.</strong></p>

<p>Our 18 – 30 group has been running since Jan 2017, it is a space in London for trans, gender variant and questioning young people between the ages of 18-30.</p>

<p>The group is a peer-led space. There is a GI team member present in the building, but essentially it will be up to members to decide how the group will work.</p>

<p>The group is a space for you to meet others your age who have experience of identifying as trans, even if you see your transition as ‘finished’, but also if you are in your 20’s and still haven’t made any decisions about your gender identity. It’s a supportive, fun, casual and safe space for you to talk about issues affecting you, programme your own events, fundraise, support each other and come up with projects.</p>
