<h2>TPOCalypse (formerly 'COLOURS' - Youth group and events for trans, gender variant and questioning young people of colour</h2>

<p><strong>Please note, all GI groups and youth service events will now take place in a mixture of in person and online settings.</strong></p>

<p>TPOCalypse is Gendered Intelligence's youth group for trans, gender variant and questioning young people of colour.</p>

<p>We run four, three-hour events across the year as a regular group, with extra trips and events, as well as an annual residential organised each year.</p>

<p>Each session is themed and might include screenings, panels, speakers and performances to create a celebratory and empowering space.</p>

<p>The group is still dedicated to self-identifying trans young people of colour only. All workers and visitors will be trans or gender variant people of colour.</p>

<p>We understand trans and non-binary people of colour can experience additional barriers and stigma. TPOCalypse is designed as a safe space for young people of colour, with disabilities, with religious beliefs who are trans men, trans women, gender non-conforming or non-binary.
We explicitly welcome and invite mixed-heritage people. It's okay if you don't feel black enough, or Asian enough, we welcome all young people of colour who are unsure or questioning their gender, or just looking to meet like-minded people.</p>
