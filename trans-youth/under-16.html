<h2>11-15 Youth Group in London</h2>

<p><strong>Please note, in light of the current situation and until further notice, all GI youth groups and youth service events will be held online.</strong></p>

<p>Gendered Intelligence runs a youth group for <strong>trans</strong>, <strong>non-binary</strong>, <strong>gender variant</strong> and <strong>gender questioning</strong> young people aged <strong>under 16</strong>. The starting age for the group is 11 years old.</p>

<p>If you are under 11, please see the our <a href="Saturday&#32;sessions.html">Under 12s group</a> or email our Youth Work lead finn.greig@genderedintelligence.co.uk.</p>

<p>The session runs on the second Thursday of each month.</p>

<p>Meetings are <strong>5.30-7.30pm</strong>, we have a relaxed first half hour from 5 â€“ 5.30pm for newcomers, parents to see the space and young people to decide if they want to stay. We meet at Caledonian Road tube station at 4.45-5pm or if you know where you're going we'll see you there.</p>

<p>Parents are welcome to stay until 5.30pm to talk to our worker and get to know us. If you need to collect your child earlier than 8pm, that is fine too.</p>

<p>Meetings take place at the Underground Youth Centre  in Holloway, Islington, N7 8TQ.
